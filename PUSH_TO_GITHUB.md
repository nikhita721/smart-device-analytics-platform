# üöÄ How to Push to GitHub

## Step-by-Step Guide to Push Your Smart Device Analytics Platform

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create New Repository**: Click the "+" icon ‚Üí "New repository"
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Name**: `smart-device-analytics-platform`
   - **Description**: `Enterprise-grade IoT data engineering platform for real-time analytics, ML Ops, and predictive maintenance`
   - **Visibility**: Public (for portfolio) or Private
   - **Initialize**: Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-device-analytics-platform.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create smart-device-analytics-platform --public --description "Enterprise-grade IoT data engineering platform for real-time analytics, ML Ops, and predictive maintenance"

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```
